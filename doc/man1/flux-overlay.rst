SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **overlay** **status** [*OPTIONS*]

**flux** **overlay** **lookup** [*OPTIONS*] *TARGET*

**flux** **overlay** **parentof** [*OPTIONS*] *RANK*

**flux** **overlay** **disconnect** [*OPTIONS*] *TARGET*


DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux-overlay status`` reports the current status of the tree based
overlay network.  The possible status values are:

full
    Node is online and no children are in *partial*, *offline*, *degraded*, or
    *lost* state.

partial
    Node is online, and some children are in *partial* or *offline* state; no
    children are in *degraded* or *lost* state.

degraded
    Node is online, and some children are in *degraded* or *lost* state.

lost
    Node has gone missing, from the parent perspective.

offline
    Node has not yet joined the instance, or has been cleanly shut down.

By default, the status of the full Flux instance is shown in graphical form,
e.g.

::

  $ flux overlay status
  0 test0: partial
  ├─ 1 test1: offline
  ├─ 2 test2: full
  ├─ 3 test3: full
  ├─ 4 test4: full
  ├─ 5 test5: offline
  ├─ 6 test6: full
  └─ 7 test7: offline

The time in the current state is reported if ``-v`` is added, e.g.

::

  $ flux overlay status -v
  0 test0: partial for 2.55448m
  ├─ 1 test1: offline for 12.7273h
  ├─ 2 test2: full for 2.55484m
  ├─ 3 test3: full for 18.2725h
  ├─ 4 test4: full for 18.2777h
  ├─ 5 test5: offline for 12.7273h
  ├─ 6 test6: full for 18.2784h
  └─ 7 test7: offline for 12.7273h

Round trip RPC times are shown with ``-vv``, e.g.

::

  0 test0: partial for 4.15692m (2.982 ms)
  ├─ 1 test1: offline for 12.754h
  ├─ 2 test2: full for 4.15755m (2.161 ms)
  ├─ 3 test3: full for 18.2992h (2.332 ms)
  ├─ 4 test4: full for 18.3045h (2.182 ms)
  ├─ 5 test5: offline for 12.754h
  ├─ 6 test6: full for 18.3052h (2.131 ms)
  └─ 7 test7: offline for 12.754h

A broker that is not responding but is not shown as *lost* or *offline* may
be forcibly disconnected from the overlay network with

::

  $ flux overlay disconnect 2
  flux-overlay: asking test0 (rank 0) to disconnect child test2 (rank 2)

However, before doing that it may be useful to see if a broker acting as a
router to that node is actually the problem.  The parent of a broker rank may
be listed with

::

  $ flux overlay parentof 2
  0

Finally, translation between hostnames and broker ranks is accomplished with

::

  $ flux overlay lookup 2
  test2
  $ flux overlay lookup test2
  2


OPTIONS
=======

``flux-overlay status`` accepts the following options:

**-h, --help**
   Display options and exit.

**-r, --rank=[RANK]**
   Check health of sub-tree rooted at NODEID (default 0).

**-v, --verbose=[LEVEL]**
   Increase reporting detail: 1=show time since current state was entered,
   2=show round-trip RPC times.

**-t, --timeout=FSD**
   Set RPC timeout, 0=disable (default 0.5s)

**--summary**
   Show only the root sub-tree status.

**--down**
   Show only the partial/degraded sub-trees.

**--no-pretty**
   Do not indent entries and use line drawing characters to show overlay
   tree structure

**--no-ghost**
   Do not fill in presumed state of nodes that are inaccessible behind
   offline/lost overlay parents.

**-L, --color=WHEN**
   Colorize output when supported; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted),
   'never', or 'auto' (default).

**-H, --highlight=TARGET**
   Highlight one or more targets and their ancestors.

**-w, --wait=STATE**
   Wait until sub-tree enters *STATE* before reporting (full, partial, offline,
   degraded, lost)>
