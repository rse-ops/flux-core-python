============
flux-exec(1)
============


SYNOPSIS
--------
**flux** **exec** [--noinput] [*--label-io] [*â€”dir=DIR'] [*--rank=NODESET*] [*--verbose*] COMMANDS...

DESCRIPTION
===========

flux-exec(1) runs commands across one or more flux-broker ranks using
the *broker.exec* service. The commands are executed as direct children
of the broker, and the broker handles buffering stdout and stderr and
sends the output back to flux-exec(1) which copies output to its own
stdout and stderr.

On receipt of SIGINT and SIGTERM signals, flux-exec(1) shall forward
the received signal to all currently running remote processes.

In the event subprocesses are hanging or ignoring SIGINT, two SIGINT
signals (typically sent via Ctrl+C) in short succession can force
flux-exec(1) to exit.

flux-exec(1) is meant as an administrative and test utility, and cannot
be used to launch Flux jobs.


EXIT STATUS
===========

In the case that all processes are successfully launched, the exit status
of flux-exec(1) is the largest of the remote process exit codes.

If a non-existent rank is targeted, flux-exec(1) will return with
code 68 (EX_NOHOST from sysexits.h).

If one or more remote commands are terminated by a signal, then flux-exec(1)
exits with exit code 128+signo.


OPTIONS
=======

**-l, --label-io**
   Label lines of output with the source RANK.

**-n, --noinput**
   Do not attempt to forward stdin. Send EOF to remote process stdin.

**-d, --dir**\ *=DIR*
   Set the working directory of remote *COMMANDS* to *DIR*. The default is to
   propagate the current working directory of flux-exec(1).

**-r, --rank**\ *=NODESET*
   Target specific ranks in *NODESET*. Default is to target "all" ranks.
   See NODESET FORMAT below for more information.

**-v, --verbose**
   Run with more verbosity.

**-q, --quiet**
   Suppress extraneous output (e.g. per-rank error exit status).
