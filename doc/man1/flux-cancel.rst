==============
flux-cancel(1)
==============


SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **cancel** [*OPTIONS*] [*JOBID...*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

flux-cancel(1) cancels one or more jobs by raising a job exception of
type=cancel. An optional message included with the cancel exception may be
provided via the *-m, --message=NOTE* option. Canceled jobs are immediately
sent SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL after a configurable timeout (default=5s).

flux-cancel(1) can target multiple jobids by either taking them on the
command line, or via the selection options *--all*, *-u, --user*, or *-S,
--states=STATES*. It is an error to provide jobids on the command line
and use one or more of the selection options.

By default *--all* will target all jobs for the current user. To target all
jobs for all users, use *--user=all* (only the instance owner is allowed
to use *--user=all*). To see how many jobs flux-cancel(1) would kill,
use the *-n --dry-run* option.

OPTIONS
