SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **cron** *COMMAND* [*OPTIONS*]


DESCRIPTION
===========

The Flux cron service offers an interface for executing commands on
triggers such as a time interval or Flux events. The service is
implemented as a Flux extension module which, when loaded, manages
a set of cron entries and uses the built-in *broker.exec* service to run
a command associated with the entry each time the defined trigger is
reached. As with :man1:`flux-exec`, these tasks run as direct children
of the flux-broker and run outside of the control of any loaded
job scheduling service.

The flux-cron(1) utility offers an interface to create, stop, start,
query, and destroy these entries in the Flux cron service.

For a detailed description of the cron service operation and how
it executes tasks, see the OPERATION and TASK EXECUTION sections
below.


COMMANDS
========

**help** *cmd*
   Print help. If *cmd* is provided, print help for that sub-command.

**sync** [--epsilon=\ *delay*] [*topic*]
   Query and modify the current **sync-event** behavior for the cron module.
   If a sync-event is set, the cron module will defer all task execution
   until an event matching the sync-event *topic* is received. With *--epsilon*
   the cron module will **not** delay task execution if the task is normally
   scheduled to run within *delay* of the matching event. Without any
   *topic* supplied on command line, *flux cron sync* displays the current
   setting for sync. If a task is deferred due to sync-event, the
   *stats.deferred* statistic is incremented.

**interval** [OPTIONS] *interval* *command*
   Create a cron entry to execute *command* every *interval*, where *interval*
   is an arbitrary floating point duration with optional suffix *s* for
   seconds, *m* for minutes, *h* for hours and *d* for days.
   Options:

   --name=\ *STRING*; -n *STRING*
      Set a name for this cron entry to *STRING*.

   --after=\ *TIME*; -a *TIME*
      The first task will run after a delay of *TIME* instead of *interval*.
      After the first task the entry will continue to execute every *interval*.

   --count=\ *N*; -c *N*
      The entry will be run a total of *N* times, then stopped.

   --options=\ *LIST*; -o *LIST*
      The *--options* option allows a comma separated list of extra options to be
      passed to the flux-cron service. See EXTRA OPTIONS below.

   --preserve-env; -E
      The *--preserve-env* option allows the current environment to be exported
      and used for the command being executed as part of the cron job. Normally,
      the broker environment is used.

   --working-dir=\ *DIR*; -d *DIR*
      The *--working-dir* option allows the working directory to be set for the command
      being executed as part of the cron job. Normally, the working directory of
      the broker is used.

**event** [OPTIONS] *topic* *command*
   Create a cron entry to execute *command* after every event matching *topic*.

   --name=\ *STRING*; -n *STRING*
      Set a name for this cron entry to *STRING*.

   --nth=\ *N*; -n *N*
      If *--nth* is given then *command* will be run after each *N* events.

   --count=\ *N*; -c *N*
      With *--count*, the entry is run *N* times then stopped.

   --after=\ *N*; -a *N*
      Run the first task only after *N* matching events. Then run every event
      or *N* events with *--nth*.

   --min-interval=\ *T*; -i *T*
      Set the minimum interval at which two cron jobs for this event will be run.
      For example, with --min-interval of 1s, the cron job will be at most run
      every 1s, even if events are generated more quickly.

   --options=\ *LIST*; -o *LIST*
      Set comma separated EXTRA OPTIONS for this cron entry.

   --preserve-env; -E
      The *--preserve-env* option allows the current environment to be exported
      and used for the command being executed as part of the cron job. Normally,
      the broker environment is used.

   --working-dir=\ *DIR*; -d *DIR*
      The *--working-dir* option allows the working directory to be set for the command
      being executed as part of the cron job. Normally, the working directory of
      the broker is used.

**tab** [OPTIONS] [*file*]
   Process one or more lines containing crontab expressions from *file*
   (stdin by default) Each valid crontab line will result in a new cron
   entry registered with the flux-cron service. The cron expression format
   supported by ``flux cron tab`` has 5 fields: *minutes* (0-59), *hours*
   (0-23), *day of month* (1-31), *month* (0-11), and *day of week* (0-6).
   Everything after the day of week is considered a command to be run.

   --options=\ *LIST*; -o *LIST*
      Set comma separated EXTRA OPTIONS for all cron entries.

**at** [OPTIONS] *string* *command*
Run *command* at specific date and time described by *string*

--options=\ *LIST*; -o *LIST*
   Set comma separated EXTRA OPTIONS for all cron entries.

--preserve-env; -E
   The *--preserve-env* option allows the current environment to be exported
   and used for the command being executed as part of the cron job. Normally,
   the broker environment is used.

--working-dir=\ *DIR*; -d *DIR*
   The *--working-dir* option allows the working directory to be set for the command
   being executed as part of the cron job. Normally, the working directory of
   the broker is used.

   **list**
      Display a list of current entries registered with the cron module and
      their current state, last run time, etc.

   **stop** *id*
      Stop cron entry *id*. The entry will remain in the cron entry list until
      deleted.

   **start** *id*
      Start a stopped cron entry *id*.

   **delete** [--kill] *id*
      Purge cron entry *id* from the flux-cron entry list. If *--kill* is used,
      kill any running task associated with entry *id*.

   **dump** [--key=KEY] *id*
      Dump all information for cron entry *id*. With *--key* print only the value
      for key *KEY*. For a list of keys run *flux cron dump ID*.


EXTRA OPTIONS
=============

For ``flux-cron`` commands allowing ``--options``, the following EXTRA OPTIONS
are supported:

timeout=\ *N*
   Set a timeout for tasks invoked for this cron entry to *N* seconds, where
   N can be a floating point number. Default is no timeout.

rank=\ *R*
   Set the rank on which to execute the cron command to *R*. Default is rank 0.

task-history-count=\ *N*
   Keep history for the last *N* tasks invoked by this cron entry. Default is 1.

stop-on-failure=\ *N*
   Automatically stop a cron entry if the failure count exceeds *N*. If *N* is
   zero (the default) then the cron entry will not be stopped on failure.


OPERATION
=========

The Flux cron module manages the set of currently configured cron
jobs as a set of common entries, each with a unique ID supplied by
a global sequence number and set of common attributes, options, and
statistics. Basic attributes of a cron job include an optional *name*,
the *command* to execute on the entry's trigger, the current *state* of
the cron entry (stopped or not stopped), a *repeat* count indicating the
total number of times to execute the cron job before stopping, and the
*type* of entry.

All cron entries also support a less common list of options, which may
be set at creation time via a comma-separated list of *option=value*
parameters passed to the *-o*, *--option=OPTS*. These options are described
in the EXTRA OPTIONS section at the end of this document.

Currently, flux-cron supports only two types of entries. The *interval*
entry supports executing a command once every configured duration,
optionally starting after a different time period. More detailed
information about the interval type can be found in the documentation for
the flux-cron *interval* command above. The *event* type entry supports
running a command once every N events matching the configured event topic.
More information about this type can be found in the documentation for
*flux cron event*.

The Flux cron module additionally keeps a common set of statistics for
each entry, regardless of type . These include the creation time, last
run time, and last time the cron entry was "started", as well a count of
total number of times the command was executed and a count of successful
and failed runs. Currently, the stats for a cron entry may be viewed via
the *flux cron dump* subcommand *stats.\** output.

When registered, cron entries are automatically *started*, meaning they
are eligible to run the configured command when the trigger condition
is met. Entries may be *stopped*, either by use of the *flux cron stop*
command, or if a *stop-on-failure* value is set. Stopped entries are
restarted using *flux cron start*, at which point counters used for
repeat and stop-on-failure are reset.

Stopped entries are kept in the flux cron until deleted with *flux
cron delete*. Active cron entries may also be deleted, with currently
executing tasks optionally killed if the *--kill* option is provided.


TASK EXECUTION
==============

As related above, cron entry commands are executed via the *broker.exec*
service, which is a low level execution service offered outside of any
scheduler control, described in more detail in the *flux-exec(1)* man
page.

Standard output and error from tasks executed by the cron service are
logged and may be viewed with :man1:`flux-dmesg`. If a cron task exits
with non-zero status, or fails to launch under the *broker.exec* service,
a message is logged and the failure is added to the failure stats.
On task failure, the cron job is stopped if *stop-on-failure* is set, and
the current failure count exceeds the configured value. By default,
*stop-on-failure* is not set.

By default, flux-cron module keeps information for the last task executed
for each cron entry. This information can be viewed either via the
*flux cron list* or *flux cron dump ID* subcommands. Data such as
start and end time, exit status, rank, and PID for the task is available.
The number of tasks kept for each cron entry may be individually tuned
via the *task-history-count* option, described in the EXTRA OPTIONS section.

Commands are normally executed immediately on the interval or event
trigger for which they are configured. However, if the *sync-event*
option is active on the cron module, tasks execution will be deferred
until the next synchronization event. See the documentation above
for *flux cron sync* for more information.
