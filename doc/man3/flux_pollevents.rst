==================
flux_pollevents(3)
==================


SYNOPSIS
========

#include <flux/core.h>

int flux_pollevents (flux_t \*h);

int flux_pollfd (flux_t \*h);


DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux_pollevents()`` returns a bitmask of poll flags for handle *h*.

``flux_pollfd()`` obtains a file descriptor that becomes readable, in
an edge triggered fashion, when ``flux_pollevents()`` has poll flags
raised.

Valid poll flags are:

FLUX_POLLIN
   Handle is ready for reading.

FLUX_POLLOUT
   Handle is ready for writing.

FLUX_POLLERR
   Handle has experienced an error.

These functions can be used to integrate a ``flux_t`` handle into an
external event loop. They are analogous to the ZMQ_FD and ZMQ_EVENTS
socket options provided by ZeroMQ.


RETURN VALUE
============

``flux_pollevents()`` returns flags on success. On error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.

``flux_pollfd()`` returns a file descriptor on success. On error, -1 is
returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
======

EINVAL
   Some arguments were invalid.


EXAMPLES
========

Here is an example of a libev "composite watcher" for a Flux handle
using the hooks provided above. This code, more or less, is used internally
to integrate flux handles into the Flux reactor, which is based on libev.
Refer to the libev documentation for background on how libev works.

There are a total of four different types of libev watcher in the
composite watcher. libev "prepare" and "check" callbacks are executed
just before and just after libev blocks internally in the
:linux:man2:`poll` system call.  Here they are used to test
``flux_pollevents()``, make user callbacks, and enable/disable no-op
"io" and "idle" watchers. The io watcher watches for EV_READ on
``flux_pollfd()`` file descriptor. The idle watcher, if enabled, is
always ready and thus causes the event loop to spin.

When ``flux_pollevents()`` has poll flags asserted, the idle watcher is enabled.
When ``flux_pollevents()`` has no poll flags asserted, the idle watcher is
disabled and the io watcher is enabled. While the idle and io watchers
have no callbacks, if either is enabled and ready, the event loop must
execute the prepare and check callbacks.

The net results are 1) the edge-triggered notification provided by
``flux_pollfd()`` is integrated with libev's level-triggered watcher
processing; 2) the handle is able to give control back to the event
loop between handle event callbacks to preserve fairness, i.e.
it doesn't have to consume events until they they are gone in one
callback; and 3) the event loop is able to sleep when there are no
handle events pending.
