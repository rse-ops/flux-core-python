SYNOPSIS
========

::

   #include <flux/shell.h>

::

   int flux_shell_service_register (flux_shell_t *shell,
                                    const char *method,
                                    flux_msg_handler_f cb,
                                    void *arg);


DESCRIPTION
===========

The job shell registers a unique service name with the flux broker on
startup, and posts the topic string for this service in the context of
the ``shell.init`` event. ``flux_shell_service_register()`` allows
registration of a request handler ``cb`` for subtopic ``method`` on this
service endpoint, allowing other job shells and/or flux commands to
interact with arbitrary services within a job.


RETURN VALUE
============

Returns -1 on failure, 0 on success.


ERRORS
======

EINVAL
   ``shell``, ``method`` or ``cb`` is NULL.
