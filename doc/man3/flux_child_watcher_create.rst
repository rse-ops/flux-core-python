DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux_child_watcher_create()`` creates a reactor watcher that
monitors state transitions of child processes. If *trace* is false,
only child termination will trigger an event; otherwise, stop and start
events may be generated.

The callback *revents* argument should be ignored.

The process id that had a transition may be obtained by calling
``flux_child_watcher_get_rpid()``.

The status value returned by :linux:man2:`waitpid` may be obtained by calling
``flux_child_watcher_get_rstatus()``.

Only a Flux reactor created with the FLUX_REACTOR_SIGCHLD flag can
be used with child watchers, as the reactor must register a SIGCHLD
signal watcher before any processes are spawned. Only one reactor instance
per program may be created with this capability.


RETURN VALUE
============

flux_child_watcher_create() returns a flux_watcher_t object on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
======

ENOMEM
   Out of memory.

EINVAL
   Reactor was not created with FLUX_REACTOR_SIGCHLD.
