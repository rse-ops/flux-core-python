flux_shell_get_jobspec_info(3)
==============================


SYNOPSIS
========

::

   #include <flux/shell.h>
   #include <errno.h>

::

   int flux_shell_get_jobspec_info (flux_shell_t *shell,
                                    char **json_str);

::

   int flux_shell_jobspec_info_unpack (flux_shell_t *shell,
                                       const char *fmt,
                                       ...);

DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux_shell_get_jobspec_info()`` returns jobspec summary information
from the flux job shell as a json string. The only key guaranteed to
be in the returned JSON object is the jobspec ``version``, e.g.

::
   {"version": 1}


For jobspec version 1, the following keys are also available:

::

   {
     "ntasks":i,         # number of tasks requested
     "nslots":i,         # number of task slots
     "cores_per_slot":i  # number of cores per task slot
     "nnodes":i          # number of nodes requested, -1 if unset
     "slots_per_node":i  # number of slots per node, -1 if unavailable
    }

This summary information is derived from the jobspec by the shell and
is shared with plugins in order to avoid duplication of effort.

Currently only version 1 jobspec is supported.

``flux_shell_jobspec_info_unpack()`` accomplishes the same thing with
Jansson-style formatting arguments.


RETURN VALUE
============

All functions return 0 on success and -1 on error.


ERRORS
======

EINVAL
   if ``shell`` is NULL, or either ``json_str`` or ``fmt`` are NULL, or if
   ``shell_rank`` is less than -1.
