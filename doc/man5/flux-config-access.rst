flux-config-access(5)
=====================


DESCRIPTION
===========

Flux normally denies access to all users except the instance owner (the user
running the Flux instance).  The system instance, however, runs as the
``flux`` user and permits limited access to guests, such as submitting work
and manipulating their own jobs.

The ``access`` table is required for a multi-user Flux system instance and may
contain the following keys:


KEYS
====

allow-guest-user
   (optional) Boolean value to allow guest users to connect and assigns them
   the ``user`` role.  If set to false or not present, connection attempts
   by guests fail with EPERM.

allow-root-owner
   (optional) Boolean value to assign ``owner`` role to root user.  If set to false
   or not present, root is treated like any other guest.


EXAMPLE
=======

::

   [access]
   allow-guest-user = true
   allow-root-owner = true
