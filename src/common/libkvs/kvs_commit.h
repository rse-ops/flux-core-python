/* FLUX_KVS_TXN_COMPACT will currently consolidate appends to the same
 * key.  For example, an append of "A" to the key "foo" and the append
 * "B" to the key "foo" maybe consolidated into a single append of
 * "AB".
 *
 * Compacting transactions means that certain ordered lists of
 * operations will be illegal to compact and result in an error.  Most
 * notably, if a key has data appended to it, then is overwritten in
 * the same transaction, a compaction of appends is not possible.
 *
 * FLUX_KVS_SYNC will ensure all data flushed to the backing store and
 * the root reference is checkpointed.  It effectively performs a:
 *
 * content.flush on rank 0
 * checkpoint on the new root reference from the commit
 *
 * FLUX_KVS_SYNC only works against the primary KVS namespace.  If any
 * part of the content.flush or checkpoint fails an error will be
 * returned and the entire commit will fail.  For example, if a
 * content backing store is not loaded, ENOSYS will returned from this
 * commit.
