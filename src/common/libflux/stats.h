/* Metric types:
 * Counter - An integer value that will, on the backend (brubeck) send the
 *           count and reset to 0 at each flush. It calculates the change
 *           from the value sent at the previous flush.
 *           An example of where to use a counter is the builtin msgcounters
 *           that are part of each flux_t handle. The counts will continually
 *           increase and brubeck will handle calculating the count sent in
 *           the interval.
 * Gauge   - An integer that takes an arbitrary value and maintains its
 *           value until it is set again. Gauges can also take incremental
 *           values in the form of a + or - in front of the value which
 *           increments the previously stored value.
 *           An example of where to use a gauge is to track the current
 *           size of the broker's content-cache. At each point, the cache's
 *           sizes are independent of each other.
 * Timing  - A double value which represents the time taken for a given
 *           task in ms.
 *           An example of where to use a timer is timing the length of
 *           asynchronous loads in the broker's content-cache. The cache
 *           entry can keep track of when the load was started and then
 *           calculate and send the time taken once the entry is loaded.
